### Restoration from scratch

helloworld.com runs on a digital ocean droplet running Ubuntu. It connects to a managed MySQL cluster. Locally, the service is managed by `systemctl` and logs are collected via `journalctl`. Secrets are in my Bitwarden.

See appendix for files.

Ensure the node only allows ssh over keys; disable passwords in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`.

Get journalctl set up and:
```
sudo systemctl restart systemd-journald
```

Set up `/home/seth/projects/helloworld` (and `punicode` and `me` / personal site).
You can create `./bin/helloworld` via scp or you can download the repo and build locally

Get the services in place and run:
```
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart helloworld.service # and punicode.service
```

Starting caddy:
```
sudo caddy stop && sudo caddy start --config Caddyfile
```

That should be enough to limp back to life.

Grafana UI can be ran from your local via a tunnel. However, for production db metrics, we have to have a
digital ocean personal access token with full db access. Use this guide to set up db monitoring but as of yet I am having trouble getting it working; maybe later:

and for getting set up with migrations, make sure to install goose
